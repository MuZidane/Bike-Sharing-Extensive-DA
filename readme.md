# Project Documentation

## Overview
This project involves data analysis and visualization using Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to analyze bike sharing data to uncover patterns and insights.

## Project Structure

- [`data/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDevelopment%2FData%20Science%2FProjects%2F15.%20Bike%20Sharing%2Fdata%2F%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "d:\Development\Data Science\Projects\15. Bike Sharing\data\"): Contains the CSV files used for analysis.
  - `day.csv`: Daily data.
  - `hour.csv`: Hourly data.
  - `Readme.txt`: Description of the data files.
- [`home.ipynb`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDevelopment%2FData%20Science%2FProjects%2F15.%20Bike%20Sharing%2Fhome.ipynb%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "d:\Development\Data Science\Projects\15. Bike Sharing\home.ipynb"): Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and visualization.
- [`readme.md`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDevelopment%2FData%20Science%2FProjects%2F15.%20Bike%20Sharing%2Freadme.md%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "d:\Development\Data Science\Projects\15.

## Setup
1. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook home.ipynb
    ```

## Key Components
- **Data Analysis**: Using Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- **Visualization**: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating plots and charts.

## Objective
The objective is to analyze bike sharing data to understand usage patterns, seasonal effects, and other insights that can help in improving the bike-sharing system.

For detailed analysis and visualizations, refer to the [`home.ipynb`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fd%3A%2FDevelopment%2FData%20Science%2FProjects%2F15.%20Bike%20Sharing%2Fhome.ipynb%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "d:\Development\Data Science\Projects\15.
